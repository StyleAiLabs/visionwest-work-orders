**Estimated Time**: 3-4 hours

### Backend Controller (Autocomplete)

- [ ] T071 [P3] [US#3] Add `getSuggestions` controller function in `backend/controllers/workOrder.controller.js`:
  - Validate query parameters: type (property/supplier), q (min 2 chars), limit (default 10, max 50)
  - Return 400 if invalid parameters
  - Query database for distinct property_name or supplier_name matching query (case-insensitive, partial match)

Phase 5 Integration & Polish (T088-T099)
```

### Parallel Execution Opportunities

**After Phase 0 Setup**:
- Backend tasks (T010-T025) and Frontend service setup (T026-T027) can run in parallel
- Email service (T011-T014) can be developed independently from controller logic (T015-T018)

**After Phase 1 Backend Complete**:
- Frontend form component (T028-T034) and frontend page (T035-T040) can be developed in parallel
- Frontend routing (T041-T045) can be done while testing backend (T021-T025)

**After P1 MVP Complete**:
- Phase 3 (Edit) and Phase 4 (Autocomplete) are independent and can be developed in parallel if resources allow

**Testing Tasks**:
- Backend testing (T021-T025) can run while frontend is being developed
- Frontend testing (T046-T052) can run while Phase 3 backend is being developed

### Recommended Implementation Order

1. **Sprint 1 (P1 MVP)**: T001-T052 (Backend + Frontend for Create Work Order)
2. **Sprint 2 (P2)**: T053-T070 (Edit Work Order)
3. **Sprint 3 (P3)**: T071-T087 (Autocomplete)
4. **Sprint 4 (Polish)**: T088-T099 (Integration Testing & Mobile Validation)

## Success Validation

After completing all tasks, verify:

- [ ] ‚úÖ Tenancy managers can create work orders in under 3 minutes (SC-001)
- [ ] ‚úÖ 95% validation pass rate on first submission (SC-002)
- [ ] ‚úÖ Work orders appear in dashboard within 5 seconds (SC-003)
- [ ] ‚úÖ Notifications delivered within 10 seconds (SC-004)
- [ ] ‚úÖ n8n webhook workflow continues to function (SC-005)
- [ ] ‚úÖ Edit changes visible immediately (SC-006)
- [ ] ‚úÖ Email notification sent to mark@williamspropertyservices.co.nz for every new manual work order

## Notes

- **Email Notifications**: Every manual work order creation (P1) triggers an email to mark@williamspropertyservices.co.nz. This is non-blocking and failures are logged but don't prevent work order creation.
- **Mobile Testing**: Constitution Principle I requires testing on actual physical devices, not just browser devtools.
- **Breaking Changes**: No changes to existing webhook endpoints per Constitution Principle III.
- **Role Mapping**: Tenancy manager role maps to existing `client_admin` role per FR-014.
