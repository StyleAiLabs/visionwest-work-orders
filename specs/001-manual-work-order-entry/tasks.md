# Tasks: Work Order Cancellation

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-manual-work-order-entry/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests are NOT included in this feature as the specification requests manual testing via Postman/curl for backend and browser testing for frontend.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3, US4, US5)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- Web app structure: `backend/` and `frontend/` directories at repository root
- Backend: `backend/controllers/`, `backend/middleware/`, `backend/models/`
- Frontend: `frontend/src/components/`, `frontend/src/pages/`, `frontend/src/services/`

**Checkpoint**: All user stories (1, 2, 3) should now be independently functional - urgent flag management complete

---

## Phase 6: User Story 4 - Attach Property Details with Autocomplete (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Provide property name autocomplete suggesting previously used properties, auto-fill associated property details when selected, maintain ability to enter new properties

**Independent Test**: Start typing property name in creation form, verify suggestions appear from existing work orders, select suggestion, verify property address and phone auto-fill, test entering new property name not in suggestions works

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phases 3-7)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order: US1 (P1) ‚Üí US3 (P2) ‚Üí US5 (P2) ‚Üí US2 (P2) ‚Üí US4 (P3)
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1) - Create Work Order**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE - No dependencies on other stories (MVP delivered)
- **User Story 2 (P2) - Edit Work Order**: Depends on US1 for work order creation, but edit functionality is independent
- **User Story 3 (P2) - Mark as Urgent**: Depends on US1 for work order creation (urgent flag on creation form), extends detail page
- **User Story 4 (P3) - Autocomplete**: Depends on US1 for property data, but autocomplete is independent enhancement
- **User Story 5 (P2) - Cancel Work Order**: Can start after Foundational - Uses existing status update infrastructure ‚úÖ **CURRENT PRIORITY**

### Suggested Implementation Order

**Current State**:
- ‚úÖ Phase 1: Setup ‚Üí Phase 2: Foundational ‚Üí COMPLETE
- ‚úÖ Phase 3: User Story 1 (Create Work Order) ‚Üí COMPLETE (2025-10-17)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Phase 5: User Story 3 (Urgent) ‚Üí PARTIALLY COMPLETE (filter integration done)
- **‚Üí Phase 7: User Story 5 (Cancel Work Order)** ‚Üê **IMPLEMENT NEXT (19 tasks)**

**Recommended Next Steps**:
1. Complete Phase 7: User Story 5 (Cancellation) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy v2.8.0
2. Complete Phase 5: User Story 3 (Urgent toggle) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy v2.9.0
3. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 (Edit) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy v2.10.0
4. Complete Phase 6: User Story 4 (Autocomplete) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy v2.11.0
5. Phase 8: Polish and final validation

**Parallel Team Strategy**:
1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together ‚úÖ DONE
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Create) ‚úÖ DONE + User Story 2 (Edit) ‚è≥ TODO
   - Developer B: User Story 5 (Cancel) ‚è≥ **START HERE** + User Story 3 (Urgent) ‚è≥ FINISH
   - Developer C: User Story 4 (Autocomplete) ‚è≥ TODO
3. Converge on Phase 8: Polish together

### Within Each User Story

- Backend API endpoints before frontend components
- Form components before page integration
- Core functionality before error handling
- Validation before notifications
- Story complete and tested before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Phase 1**: T003 and T004 (database verification) can run in parallel with T002 (dependency check)
- **Phase 2**: All verification tasks (T007-T011) can run in parallel
- **User Story 2**: T030 (edit form) and T034 (API endpoint) can start in parallel
- **User Story 3**: T040 (urgent checkbox) and T043 (urgent badge) can run in parallel
- **User Story 4**: T055, T056 (API suggestions) and T058 (autocomplete input) can start in parallel
- **User Story 5**: T064-T068 (backend changes) and T069-T071 (dialog component) can run in parallel
- **Phase 8**: T083 and T084 (version bumps) can run in parallel

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 5 (Cancellation)

```bash
# Launch backend and frontend tasks in parallel:

# Backend Team:
Task: "T064 [P] [US5] Update handleWorkOrderStatusUpdate middleware in backend/middleware/auth.middleware.js"
Task: "T066 [US5] Update updateWorkOrderStatus controller in backend/controllers/workOrder.controller.js"

# Frontend Team (can start at same time):
Task: "T069 [P] [US5] Create ConfirmCancelDialog component in frontend/src/components/workOrders/ConfirmCancelDialog.jsx"
Task: "T072 [P] [US5] Add cancel button to WorkOrderSummary.jsx"

# After both complete:
Task: "T075 [US5] Add handleConfirmCancel function connecting dialog to API"
```
