# Specification Quality Checklist: Manual Work Order Entry

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-16
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)
**Status**: ✅ PASSED - Ready for `/speckit.plan`

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Iteration 1 - Final**: All checklist items passed ✅

**Clarifications Resolved**:
- **Q1: Tenancy Manager Role Mapping** - RESOLVED: User selected Option A (map to `client_admin` role)
  - Updated FR-014 to specify `client_admin` role mapping
  - Updated Assumptions section to reflect no database migration needed
  - All current client_admin users will gain manual work order creation capability

**Quality Assessment**:
- Specification avoids all technical implementation details
- All requirements are testable with clear acceptance criteria
- Success criteria use measurable, user-focused metrics
- 3 prioritized user stories provide clear incremental delivery path
- MVP (P1) delivers core value: manual work order creation
- Constitution compliance: Mobile-first design, n8n integration preserved, user story-driven

## Notes

✅ **Specification is complete and ready for planning phase**

Next steps:
- Run `/speckit.plan` to generate implementation plan
- OR run `/speckit.clarify` if additional refinement needed (though not required)
