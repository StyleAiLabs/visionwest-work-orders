# Email Notification Requirements Quality Checklist

**Purpose**: Validate the completeness, clarity, and consistency of email notification requirements for manual work order creation.

**Created**: 2025-10-19
**Feature**: Manual Work Order Entry (001)
**Focus**: Email notifications via env-configured recipients for UI-created work orders
**Depth**: Light (alerting/notification requirements)

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] CHK001 - Are the specific environment variable names (EMAIL_NOTIFICATION_RECIPIENT, EMAIL_NOTIFICATION_RECIPIENT_2) explicitly documented in requirements? [Gap]
- [ ] CHK002 - Is the trigger condition "when manual work order is created via UI" precisely defined in requirements? [Clarity, Spec §FR-008]
- [ ] CHK003 - Are email recipient requirements specified for both primary and secondary recipients? [Completeness, Gap]
- [ ] CHK004 - Is the notification scope explicitly limited to manual UI-created work orders (excluding automated/webhook work orders)? [Clarity, Gap]
- [ ] CHK005 - Are requirements defined for what happens when environment variables are missing or empty? [Edge Case, Gap]
- [ ] CHK006 - Is the email subject line format specified in requirements? [Gap]
- [ ] CHK007 - Are the required email body fields/content specified (e.g., job number, property, date, creator)? [Gap]
- [ ] CHK008 - Is email format (plain text vs HTML) specified in requirements? [Gap]

## Requirement Clarity

- [ ] CHK009 - Is "light notification to alert the user" quantified with specific content requirements? [Clarity, Ambiguity]
- [ ] CHK010 - Is the timing requirement "within 10 seconds" from Spec §SC-004 still applicable for env-based notifications? [Clarity, Spec §SC-004]
- [ ] CHK011 - Are multiple recipients in EMAIL_NOTIFICATION_RECIPIENT_2 handled (comma-separated, single address, etc.)? [Clarity, Gap]
- [ ] CHK012 - Is "successfully created" defined with specific system state criteria? [Clarity, Gap]

## Requirement Consistency

- [ ] CHK013 - Do env-based recipient requirements (EMAIL_NOTIFICATION_RECIPIENT) align with Spec §FR-008 requirement for "all active staff, admin, and client users"? [Consistency, Conflict, Spec §FR-008]
- [ ] CHK014 - Are notification requirements consistent between manual and automated work order creation paths? [Consistency, Gap]
- [ ] CHK015 - Does the env-based approach conflict with the existing user notification system mentioned in Spec §FR-008? [Conflict, Spec §FR-008]

## Scenario Coverage

- [ ] CHK016 - Are requirements defined for the scenario where EMAIL_NOTIFICATION_RECIPIENT is configured but EMAIL_NOTIFICATION_RECIPIENT_2 is not? [Coverage, Edge Case]
- [ ] CHK017 - Are requirements defined for the scenario where both env variables are configured? [Coverage, Gap]
- [ ] CHK018 - Are requirements defined for the scenario where neither env variable is configured? [Coverage, Edge Case]
- [ ] CHK019 - Are requirements specified for concurrent work order creations triggering multiple emails? [Coverage, Edge Case]

## Exception & Error Handling

- [ ] CHK020 - Are requirements defined for email send failures (SMTP errors, network issues)? [Gap, Exception Flow]
- [ ] CHK021 - Is fallback behavior specified when email delivery fails? [Gap, Recovery]
- [ ] CHK022 - Are requirements defined for invalid email address formats in env variables? [Edge Case, Gap]
- [ ] CHK023 - Is logging/auditing of email send attempts required in specifications? [Gap, Non-Functional]
- [ ] CHK024 - Are retry requirements specified for failed email deliveries? [Gap, Recovery]

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] CHK025 - Are performance requirements defined for email sending (should it block work order creation)? [Gap, Non-Functional]
- [ ] CHK026 - Are security requirements specified for email content (PII, sensitive data)? [Gap, Security]
- [ ] CHK027 - Is the email delivery timing requirement (synchronous vs asynchronous) specified? [Gap, Non-Functional]
- [ ] CHK028 - Are requirements defined for email rate limiting or throttling? [Gap, Non-Functional]

## Configuration & Dependencies

- [ ] CHK029 - Are environment variable requirements documented in a centralized configuration spec or README? [Traceability, Gap]
- [ ] CHK030 - Are validation requirements specified for EMAIL_NOTIFICATION_RECIPIENT values at system startup? [Gap]
- [ ] CHK031 - Are dependencies on email service (SMTP, nodemailer, Brevo) explicitly documented? [Dependency, Gap]
- [ ] CHK032 - Is the relationship between env-based notifications and existing emailService.js implementation clarified? [Dependency, Gap]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [ ] CHK033 - Can "light notification to alert the user" be objectively verified/tested? [Measurability, Ambiguity]
- [ ] CHK034 - Are success criteria defined for email notification delivery? [Gap, Acceptance Criteria]
- [ ] CHK035 - Is there a measurable requirement for notification content completeness? [Gap, Acceptance Criteria]
- [ ] CHK036 - Are the acceptance criteria for Spec §SC-004 ("within 10 seconds") still applicable and testable? [Measurability, Spec §SC-004]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [ ] CHK037 - Does the env-variable approach contradict Spec §FR-008's requirement for user-based notifications? [Conflict, Spec §FR-008]
- [ ] CHK038 - Is the purpose of EMAIL_NOTIFICATION_RECIPIENT_2 clearly distinguished from EMAIL_NOTIFICATION_RECIPIENT? [Ambiguity, Gap]
- [ ] CHK039 - Is "alert the user" ambiguous - which user (creator, recipients, or both)? [Ambiguity]
- [ ] CHK040 - Are the requirements clear about whether this replaces or supplements existing notification mechanisms? [Ambiguity, Gap]

**Total Items**: 40
**Traceability**: 9 items reference existing spec sections (23%), 31 items identify gaps or ambiguities (77%)

**Summary**: This checklist validates requirements for env-configured email notifications on manual work order creation. Key focus areas:
- Environment variable configuration (EMAIL_NOTIFICATION_RECIPIENT, EMAIL_NOTIFICATION_RECIPIENT_2)
- Trigger scope (UI-created manual work orders only)
- Light notification content requirements
- Error handling and edge cases
- Alignment with existing Spec §FR-008 notification requirements
