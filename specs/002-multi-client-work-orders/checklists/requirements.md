# Specification Quality Checklist: Multi-Client Work Order Management

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-17
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)
**Status**: ✅ PASSED - Ready for `/speckit.plan`

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Iteration 1 - Final**: All checklist items passed ✅

**Quality Assessment**:
- Specification is technology-agnostic and focuses on business value
- Four prioritized user stories with clear P1/P2 distinction:
  - P1: Client Data Isolation (MVP foundation)
  - P1: Global Admin Client Management (operational necessity)
  - P1: Seamless Legacy Data Migration (deployment prerequisite)
  - P2: Staff Cross-Client Access (enhancement after MVP)
- All 18 functional requirements are testable and unambiguous
- Success criteria use measurable, user-focused metrics:
  - 100% data isolation verification
  - 3-second context switching performance
  - Zero data loss during migration
  - <10% performance impact
  - Support for 10+ concurrent clients
  - Zero cross-client violations in 90 days
- Edge cases cover critical multi-tenant scenarios:
  - Orphaned users (no client assignment)
  - Legacy data handling
  - Client deletion with dependencies
  - Concurrent admin operations
  - Cross-client notifications
- Assumptions clearly document decisions and constraints
- Dependencies and out-of-scope items are explicitly listed
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - all aspects have reasonable defaults or clear specifications

**Constitution Alignment Preview**:
- ✅ Principle III (Integration Integrity): Spec explicitly states n8n workflow will continue with Visionwest client
- ✅ Principle V (Security & Data Protection): Strong focus on data isolation and access control
- ⚠️ Principle I (Mobile-First Design): Admin panel must be designed mobile-first per constitution
- ✅ Principle IV (User Story-Driven): Clear P1 MVP vs P2 enhancement separation

## Notes

✅ **Specification is complete and ready for planning phase**

**Key Strengths**:
1. Clear multi-tenant data isolation model
2. Well-defined migration strategy preserving existing Visionwest operations
3. Role-based access patterns (client, client_admin, admin, staff) clearly specified
4. Measurable success criteria with specific metrics
5. Comprehensive edge case coverage for multi-tenant scenarios

**Planning Phase Considerations**:
1. Database migration must be carefully planned (Principle III - no disruption to existing operations)
2. JWT token structure needs client_id inclusion
3. Admin UI must follow mobile-first design principle
4. API middleware for automatic client scoping needs architecture
5. Performance testing required to validate <10% impact assumption

Next steps:
- Run `/speckit.plan` to generate implementation plan
- Constitution check will validate mobile-first admin UI approach
- Migration script design will be critical for zero-downtime deployment
