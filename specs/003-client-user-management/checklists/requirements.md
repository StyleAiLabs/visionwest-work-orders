# Specification Quality Checklist: Client User Management

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-19
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality - PASS
- Specification contains no implementation details (no mention of specific frameworks, languages, or technical architecture)
- All content focuses on user capabilities and business value
- Language is accessible to non-technical stakeholders (e.g., "client admin can create users" rather than "API endpoint creates user records")
- All three mandatory sections are complete: User Scenarios & Testing, Requirements, Success Criteria

### Requirement Completeness - PASS
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present in the specification
- All 12 functional requirements are specific and testable (e.g., "System MUST validate that email addresses are in a valid format" can be tested)
- Success criteria include measurable metrics: "under 1 minute", "under 30 seconds", "100%", "zero data loss", "within 5 minutes", "up to 500 users"
- Success criteria are technology-agnostic, focusing on user-facing outcomes rather than system implementation
- All three user stories have defined acceptance scenarios with Given/When/Then format
- Edge cases section identifies 5 specific edge cases to consider
- Scope Boundaries section clearly defines what is in scope and out of scope
- Assumptions section documents 6 assumptions, and Dependencies section lists 4 dependencies

### Feature Readiness - PASS
- Each of the 12 functional requirements maps to acceptance scenarios in the user stories
- User scenarios cover the three primary flows: create users (P1), update roles (P2), update contact details (P3)
- The six success criteria directly measure the outcomes described in the user scenarios
- Entire specification maintains focus on "what" and "why" without specifying "how"

## Notes

- Specification is ready for planning phase
- All checklist items passed validation
- No updates required before proceeding to `/speckit.plan`
