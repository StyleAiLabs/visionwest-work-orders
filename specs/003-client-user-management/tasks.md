# Tasks: Client User Management

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/003-client-user-management/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/user-api.yaml
**Feature Branch**: `003-client-user-management`
**Version Bump**: 2.6.0 ‚Üí 2.7.0 (minor - new feature)

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story (P1, P2, P3) to enable independent implementation and testing of each story. Follow the P1 MVP validation pattern: Backend ‚Üí Frontend ‚Üí Manual Testing ‚Üí Integration Testing.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Backend**: `backend/` directory (Express API)
- **Frontend**: `frontend/` directory (React SPA)
- **Migrations**: `backend/migrations/`
- **Existing files**: Marked as EXISTING - will be extended/modified

---

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

- [X] T009 Create backend/utils/passwordGenerator.js utility with generateSecurePassword() function using crypto.randomBytes
- [X] T010 Update backend/utils/emailService.js with sendNewUserCredentialsEmail(user, temporaryPassword) function using Brevo API (with nodemailer fallback) and brand-compliant HTML template following NextGen WOM brand guidelines (Deep Navy #0e2640 header, NextGen Green #8bc63b CTA button, Rich Black #010308 text on Pure White #ffffff background)
- [X] T011 Test password generator by running `node -e "console.log(require('./utils/passwordGenerator').generateSecurePassword())"` from backend/
- [X] T012 Create database migration file backend/migrations/YYYYMMDDHHMMSS-add-password-changed-field.js to add password_changed BOOLEAN field to users table (defaults to false)
- [X] T013 Run migration using `npx sequelize-cli db:migrate` from backend/ directory to add password_changed field

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Story 1 (Phase 3)**: Depends on Foundational completion - MVP feature
- **User Story 2 (Phase 4)**: Depends on User Story 1 completion (extends edit functionality)
- **User Story 3 (Phase 5)**: Depends on User Story 2 completion (extends edit functionality further)
- **Polish (Phase 6)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories - **MVP DELIVERABLE**
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Depends on User Story 1 (reuses EditUserModal structure)
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Depends on User Story 2 (extends same edit modal with more fields)

### Within Each User Story

- Backend implementation before frontend implementation (API must exist first)
- Controllers before routes (controllers are used by routes)
- Services and utilities before controllers (controllers depend on utilities)
- Frontend components before pages (pages compose components)
- Manual testing after implementation (verify functionality works)
- Integration testing after manual testing (verify no regressions)

### Parallel Opportunities

**Phase 1 (Setup)**:
- T002, T003, T004 can run in parallel (different package.json files)

**Phase 2 (Foundational)**:
- T009 and T010 can run in parallel (different files: passwordGenerator.js and emailService.js)

**User Story 1 - Frontend**:
- T033, T034, T035, T036 can run in parallel (all in userService.js, but different functions)
- After userService complete: T037-T044 (CreateUserForm), T045-T050 (UserList), T051-T062 (UserManagementPage) can work in parallel by different developers

**User Story 2 - Frontend**:
- T092 can start in parallel with backend T083-T088 (frontend component stub)

**User Story 3 - Frontend**:
- T116-T123 extend existing EditUserModal.jsx (must be sequential)

**Phase 6 (Polish)**:
- T131, T132, T135, T136, T137 can run in parallel (different files/tasks)

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1 Backend

```bash
# After T011 complete, launch backend tasks in parallel:
Task T012: Create user.controller.js (file 1)
Task T024: Create user.routes.js (file 2) - can start stub while controller is being filled

# After T032 complete (backend done), launch frontend tasks in parallel:
Task T033-T036: userService.js functions (file 3)
Task T037-T044: CreateUserForm.jsx (file 4)
Task T045-T050: UserList.jsx (file 5)
Task T051-T062: UserManagementPage.jsx (file 6)
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T005)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T006-T011) - **CRITICAL BLOCKER**
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 Backend (T012-T032)
4. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 Frontend (T033-T062)
5. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 Testing (T063-T082)
6. **STOP and VALIDATE**: User Story 1 should be fully functional independently
7. Deploy P1 MVP if ready for production

### Incremental Delivery

1. Foundation (Phase 1 + 2) ‚Üí Database migration and utilities ready
2. P1 MVP (Phase 3) ‚Üí Client admins can create users ‚Üí **Deploy/Demo**
3. P2 Enhancement (Phase 4) ‚Üí Client admins can update roles ‚Üí **Deploy/Demo**
4. P3 Enhancement (Phase 5) ‚Üí Client admins can update contacts ‚Üí **Deploy/Demo**
5. Polish (Phase 6) ‚Üí Version bump, release notes, final validation ‚Üí **Deploy to Production**

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. **Phase 1-2**: Team completes Setup + Foundational together (blocking for all)
2. **Phase 3 (US1)**:
   - Developer A: Backend (T012-T032)
   - After T032: Developer B can start Frontend (T033-T062) in parallel with Developer A doing manual testing
3. **Phase 4-5 (US2-US3)**: Can be done sequentially or by different developers if desired
4. **Phase 6**: Team completes polish tasks together

## Notes

- **[P]** marker = tasks that can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[US1/US2/US3]** marker = maps task to specific user story for traceability
- **MVP = User Story 1 (P1)** - This alone delivers value and should be tested independently
- Verify backend endpoints work before building frontend (use curl/Postman for T028-T032)
- Test on actual mobile devices (iOS Safari, Android Chrome) before considering P1 complete
- Email credentials should arrive within 5 minutes (SC-005 from spec.md)
- User list should handle 500 users without performance degradation (SC-006 from spec.md)
- Commit after completing each user story phase (not after every task - too granular)
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently before proceeding
- No tests requested in spec.md - manual testing only

---

## Success Criteria Validation

Before marking feature complete, verify these from spec.md:

- [ ] **SC-001**: Client admins can create user account in under 1 minute
- [ ] **SC-002**: Client admins can update role/contact in under 30 seconds
- [ ] **SC-003**: 100% of user management operations restricted to client_admin role
- [ ] **SC-004**: All user changes persist correctly with zero data loss
- [ ] **SC-005**: New users receive credentials email within 5 minutes
- [ ] **SC-006**: User management handles 500 users per org without performance degradation
