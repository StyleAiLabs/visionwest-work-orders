## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Dropdown Too Small on Mobile
**Solution**: Verify `minHeight: '44px'` is applied
**Code**: `frontend/src/components/workOrders/ClientFilter.jsx:79`

### Issue: Picker Doesn't Appear
**Possible Causes**:
- JavaScript error (check console)
- CSS z-index conflict
- Browser compatibility issue

**Debug Steps**:
1. Open browser console (if supported on mobile)
2. Check for errors
3. Try different browser (Safari vs Chrome on iOS)

### Issue: Text Too Small
