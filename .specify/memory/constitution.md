# NextGen WOM Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Mobile-First Design (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

All features MUST be designed and tested for mobile devices first, then adapted for desktop. The system is a Progressive Web App where field workers use smartphones as the primary interface.

**Requirements**:
- Touch targets minimum 44px
- Responsive layouts using Tailwind breakpoints (sm: 640px, md: 768px, lg: 1024px)
- Offline functionality via PWA service workers
- Test on actual mobile devices before considering feature complete

**Rationale**: Field workers access the system on-site using mobile devices. Desktop optimization is secondary.

### II. Multi-Client Data Isolation (SECURITY CRITICAL)

Every database query MUST enforce client-level data isolation through `client_id` filtering. Never rely on application-level filtering alone.

**Requirements**:
- All `users` and `work_orders` tables MUST have `client_id` foreign key
- Controller methods MUST build `whereClause` with client filtering before any database query
- Pattern in `workOrder.controller.js` is canonical: `getSummary()`, `getAllWorkOrders()`, `getAuthorizedPersons()` all use role-specific `whereClause`
- New models MUST include `client_id` if they contain client-specific data

**Rationale**: Multi-tenant architecture prevents data leakage between organizations. Database-level isolation is the only safe approach.

### III. Role-Based Access Control

Access control MUST be enforced at the API route level using role-specific middleware. Four roles with distinct access patterns:

**Roles**:
- `client`: Sees only work orders where `authorized_email` matches their email; Can request cancellation only
- `client_admin`: Sees all work orders for their client organization; Can create and update work orders for their client
- `staff`: Sees all work orders across all clients; Can view and update any work order; CANNOT delete work orders; NO access to admin section (user management)
- `admin`: Full system access; Can view, update, and delete any work order; Full access to admin section including user management and client management

**Permission Matrix**:
| Action | client | client_admin | staff | admin |
|--------|--------|--------------|-------|-------|
| View own client work orders | ✅ (filtered by email) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| View all client work orders | ❌ | ✅ (own client) | ✅ (all clients) | ✅ (all clients) |
| Create work order | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Update work order | ❌ | ✅ (own client) | ✅ (all clients) | ✅ (all clients) |
| Delete work order | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Cancel work order | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Access admin section | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| User management | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Client management | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |

**Requirements**:
- All routes use `authMiddleware.verifyToken` + role middleware (e.g., `authMiddleware.isAnyValidRole`, `authMiddleware.isStaffOrAdmin`, `authMiddleware.isAdmin`)
- Status updates have special logic: clients can only set status to `'cancelled'`
- Client ownership validation MUST skip for `staff` and `admin` roles (they bypass client scoping)
- DELETE endpoints protected by `authMiddleware.isAdmin` only
- Admin section routes protected by `authMiddleware.isAdmin` only
- Maintain consistency between dashboard summaries and work order listings

**Rationale**: Clear role separation prevents unauthorized access while enabling appropriate visibility. Staff can manage all work orders operationally without administrative privileges like deletion or user management.

### IV. Brand Consistency (NextGen WOM Identity)

All UI components MUST use the NextGen WOM color palette and design system defined in `.specify/memory/brand-kit-guidelines.md`.

**Required Colors** (Tailwind config):
- `deep-navy` (#0e2640) - Headers, navigation, primary elements
- `nextgen-green` (#8bc63b) - CTAs, accents, success states
- `rich-black` (#010308) - Body text, high contrast
- `pure-white` (#ffffff) - Backgrounds, cards

**Requirements**:
- No hardcoded colors outside Tailwind config
- Status colors: pending (amber), in-progress (nextgen-green), completed (nextgen-green), cancelled (red)
- WCAG AA contrast compliance mandatory (see brand-kit-guidelines.md for verification)
- Icons from Heroicons outline style only

**Rationale**: Consistent branding reinforces professional identity and maintains accessibility standards.

### V. Environment Parity

Code MUST behave identically across development, staging, and production environments. Only configuration differs.

**Environments**:
- **Development**: `npm run dev` - Uses `sequelize.sync({ alter: true })` for schema changes
- **Staging**: `npm run dev:staging` - Uses staging database, authentication only (no sync)
- **Production**: `npm start` - Runs migrations via Sequelize CLI, then starts server

**Requirements**:
- Environment switching: `node scripts/set-env.js [staging|development]` copies appropriate `.env.*` file
- Never use `NODE_ENV` checks to alter business logic
- Database connection configs in `backend/config/db.config.js`
- Test staging deployment before production merge

**Rationale**: Environment-specific bugs are prevented when code paths are identical and only data sources differ.

### VI. Release Documentation Required

Every feature update MUST include updated release notes documenting user-facing changes.

**Requirements**:
- Version follows semantic versioning: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH (currently 2.7.0)
- MAJOR: Breaking API changes, database schema removals, role permission changes
- MINOR: New features, new API endpoints, new UI components
- PATCH: Bug fixes, typo corrections, performance improvements
- Release notes MUST be created in `/release-notes` folder as `release-X.Y.Z-summary.md`
- Release notes MUST be added to Settings → App Information → Release Notes (in ReleaseNotesPage.jsx)
- Version MUST be updated in:
  - `frontend/package.json` - Frontend version
  - `backend/package.json` - Backend version (used by /api/app/info endpoint)
  - `frontend/src/pages/SettingsPage.jsx` - Fallback version display
  - `frontend/src/pages/ReleaseNotesPage.jsx` - Latest version entry
- Document in commit message and create GitHub release notes
- Include migration instructions if database schema changes

**Release Notes Structure**:
- Summary section with release date and type
- New Features (user-facing capabilities)
- Bug Fixes (issues resolved)
- Technical Improvements (developer-facing changes)
- Breaking Changes (if any)
- Upgrade Instructions

**Rationale**: Deployment teams and clients need clear change documentation for production updates. Users can view release history from Settings → App Information → View Release Notes.

### VII. Integration Resilience

External service integrations (n8n webhooks, SMS notifications) MUST be asynchronous and failure-tolerant.

**Requirements**:
- Use `setImmediate()` for async operations after responding to user (see `workOrder.controller.js:updateWorkOrderStatus`)
- SMS notifications via `smsService.sendWorkOrderStatusSMS()` - failure logs but doesn't block
- n8n webhook creates work orders with VisionWest `client_id` by default
- Webhook endpoint bypasses JWT authentication using `WEBHOOK_API_KEY` header
- Test webhooks with `/scripts/test-webhook.js` script

**Rationale**: External service failures should never block user operations or corrupt application state.

## Brand Guidelines

### Color Palette Standards

All UI development MUST reference `.specify/memory/brand-kit-guidelines.md` for comprehensive color, typography, and component specifications.

**Enforcement**:
- Use Tailwind classes, never inline hex codes
- Component examples in brand-kit-guidelines.md are canonical
- Accessibility contrast ratios are pre-verified in guidelines document

### Typography Hierarchy

- Headers: Rich Black for maximum contrast
- Body Text: Rich Black (primary), Gray 600 (secondary)
- Interactive Text: NextGen Green for links and active states
- Error Text: Red 600 (#dc2626)
- Success Text: NextGen Green

## Development Environments

### Local Development Setup

**Backend**:
```bash
cd backend
npm install
cp .env.example .env  # Configure database credentials
npm run dev           # Start with nodemon + sequelize sync
```

**Frontend**:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev           # Start Vite dev server on port 5173
```

### Database Seeding

- **Production Users**: `npm run setup` (creates VisionWest client users)
- **Development Data**: `node utils/seeder.js` (generates test work orders)
- **Test Credentials**: See `backend/README.md` "Development Notes" section

### Environment Switching

```bash
# Switch to staging database
node scripts/set-env.js staging

# Switch back to development
node scripts/set-env.js development
```

### Testing Scripts

- `node scripts/test-webhook.js` - Verify n8n integration
- `node scripts/test-client-api.js` - Test client management
- `node scripts/validate-migration.js` - Verify database schema
- `node scripts/test-data-integrity.js` - Multi-client validation

## Deployment Pipeline

### Branch Strategy

- **dev branch** → Auto-deploys to:
  - Frontend: https://demo.wom.wpsg.nz/
  - Backend: https://visionwest-api.onrender.com/
  
- **main branch** → Auto-deploys to:
  - Frontend: https://app.wom.wpsg.nz/

## Governance

### Constitution Authority

This constitution supersedes all other development practices and guidelines. When conflicts arise, constitution principles take precedence.

### Amendment Procedure

1. Propose amendment with rationale and impact analysis
2. Update version number following semantic versioning:
   - MAJOR: Removing/redefining principles (backward incompatible)
   - MINOR: Adding new principles or sections
   - PATCH: Clarifications, typos, non-semantic refinements
3. Update dependent templates (plan, spec, tasks)
4. Document in Sync Impact Report (HTML comment at file top)
5. Commit with message: `docs: amend constitution to vX.Y.Z (description)`

### Compliance Review

- **Quarterly**: Review all principles against current codebase
- **Pre-PR**: Verify new code aligns with constitution
- **Architecture Changes**: Requires constitution update or explicit violation justification

### Violation Handling

Principle violations MUST be documented in implementation plan's "Complexity Tracking" table with:
- Which principle is violated
- Why violation is necessary
- What simpler alternative was rejected and why

**Version**: 1.1.0 | **Ratified**: 2025-10-20 | **Last Amended**: 2025-10-20 | **App Version**: 2.7.0
