**Release Date:** October 18, 2025
**Type:** Minor Version Update

## Summary
Version 2.6.0 introduces significant enhancements to the manual work order creation feature, including photo upload capabilities, auto-fill functionality, and improved validation. This release streamlines the work order entry process and ensures data consistency.

## New Features

### üì∏ Photo Upload Functionality
- **Before Photos Support**: Users can now upload multiple "before" photos when creating a work order
- **Camera Integration**: Direct camera capture on mobile devices and desktops with webcam
- **Gallery Upload**: Select multiple photos from device gallery
- **Photo Validation**: Automatic validation for file type (images only) and size (max 5MB per photo)
- **Photo Preview**: Visual preview grid with ability to remove selected photos before submission
- **Graceful Error Handling**: Work order creation succeeds even if photo upload fails, with appropriate user notifications

### üîÑ Auto-Fill Functionality
- **Supplier Auto-Fill**: Automatically sets supplier to "Williams Property Service" with predefined contact details
  - Phone: 021 123 4567
  - Email: info@williamspropertyservices.co.nz
- **Authorization Auto-Fill**: Automatically populates authorized by fields from logged-in user's profile
  - Authorized By: User's full name
  - Authorized Contact: User's phone number
  - Authorized Email: User's email address
- **Editable Fields**: Auto-filled authorization fields remain editable for flexibility

### ‚úÖ Enhanced Validation
- **Mandatory Property Details**: Property address and phone are now required fields
- **Field Validation**: Comprehensive validation for job number format, email addresses, and required fields
- **User-Friendly Error Messages**: Clear, descriptive error messages for validation failures
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Prevents creation of work orders with duplicate job numbers

## User Interface Improvements

### üìù Form Layout Enhancements
- **Hidden Supplier Fields**: Supplier input fields removed from UI (auto-filled on backend)
- **Required Field Indicators**: Visual asterisk (*) indicators for mandatory fields
- **Informational Tooltips**: Blue info boxes explaining auto-fill behavior and photo upload tips
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive form layout optimized for mobile and desktop
- **Section Organization**: Clearly organized sections for Required Information, Before Photos, and Authorization Details

- **Success/Error Toasts**: Clear toast notifications for work order creation status
- **Loading States**: Disabled buttons and loading indicators during submission

## Technical Improvements

### üîß Backend Enhancements
- **Default Value Enforcement**: Backend always enforces Williams Property Service as supplier (ignores frontend input)
- **User Profile Integration**: Fetches user details from database to auto-populate authorization fields
- **Improved Validation Logic**: Updated validation to require property_address and property_phone
- **Correct Column Mapping**: Fixed database column references (phone_number instead of phone)
- **Work Order Type Tracking**: Manual work orders tagged with work_order_type: "manual"

### üìä Frontend Architecture
- **React Hook Form**: Utilizes react-hook-form for efficient form state management
- **File Handling**: Browser File API for photo selection and preview URL management
- **Two-Step Workflow**: Creates work order first, then uploads photos separately
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of object URLs to prevent memory leaks
- **Error Boundaries**: Graceful handling of photo upload failures without blocking work order creation

### üß™ Testing & Documentation

## API Changes

### Endpoints Modified
- **POST /api/work-orders**: Enhanced to support new validation rules and auto-fill logic
- **Validation Updates**:
  - Now requires: job_no, property_name, property_address, property_phone, description
  - No longer requires: supplier_name, supplier_phone, supplier_email (auto-filled)

### Response Format
Work order creation response now includes:
- work_order_type: "manual" for manually created work orders
- Auto-filled supplier details in database
- Auto-filled authorization details from user profile

## Bug Fixes

### üêõ Issues Resolved
- **Database Column Name**: Fixed phone field reference (corrected to phone_number)
- **Supplier Override**: Ensures Williams Property Service is always set, regardless of manual input
- **JWT Token Handling**: Improved token validation and error messages
- **Field Validation**: Proper error messages for missing required fields

## Database Changes

### Schema Updates
- No schema changes required
- Existing columns utilized: supplier_name, supplier_phone, supplier_email, property_address, property_phone
- work_order_type column set to "manual" for manual entries

## Security & Access Control

### üîí Role-Based Access
- **Client Admin Only**: Manual work order creation restricted to client_admin role
- **Permission Checks**: Frontend and backend validation of user permissions
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages for unauthorized access attempts
- **Automatic Redirect**: Non-authorized users redirected to work orders list

## Performance

- **Optimized Photo Upload**: Photos uploaded after work order creation to avoid blocking
- **Efficient Validation**: Client-side validation reduces unnecessary API calls
- **Responsive UI**: Smooth user experience with appropriate loading states

## Migration Notes
