# Release 2.7.0 - Staff Role Access Control Enhancements

**Release Date:** October 20, 2025
**Type:** Minor Version Update

## Summary
Version 2.7.0 introduces comprehensive role-based access control improvements for staff users, enabling them to view and manage work orders across all clients. This release aligns staff user capabilities with constitution v1.1.0 principles while maintaining proper security boundaries between staff and admin roles.

## New Features

### 👥 Staff User Multi-Client Access
- **Cross-Client Visibility**: Staff users can now view work orders from all clients (not restricted to a single client)
- **Client Filter for Staff**: Staff users now see the Client dropdown filter on the Work Orders page
- **Client Context Switching**: Staff users can filter work orders by selecting specific clients or view all clients
- **Authorized Person Filtering**: Authorized person filter properly updates based on selected client

### 🔒 Enhanced Role-Based Access Control
- **Constitution v1.1.0 Compliance**: Updated access control to align with latest constitution principles
- **Staff vs Admin Distinctions**:
  - **Staff**: Can view and update work orders across all clients, cannot delete or access admin panel
  - **Admin**: Full system access including work order deletion and admin panel access
- **Permission Matrix**: Clear separation of capabilities documented in constitution

### 🎯 Client Filter Synchronization
- **Dynamic Filter Updates**: Authorized person filter automatically reloads when client filter changes
- **Smart Filter Reset**: Authorized person selection clears when switching clients
- **Context-Aware Data**: Filters show only relevant data for the selected client
- **All Clients Option**: Select "All Clients" to see work orders across all organizations

## User Interface Improvements

### 📊 Work Orders Dashboard (Staff Users)
- **Client Filter Visibility**: Client dropdown now visible for staff users (previously admin-only)
- **Coordinated Filters**: Client and authorized person filters work together seamlessly
- **Filter State Management**: Proper reset and reload behavior when switching between filters
- **Loading States**: Clear loading indicators when filters are updating

### 🔄 Filter Behavior
- **Auto-Reset on Client Change**: Authorized person filter automatically resets to "All Authorized Persons" when client changes
- **Contextual Options**: Authorized person dropdown shows only persons from the selected client
- **Preserved Selections**: Valid selections maintained when compatible with new client context
- **Clear Visual Feedback**: User understands which client context they're operating in

## Technical Improvements

### 🔧 Backend Enhancements
- **Client Routes Updated**: `/api/clients/list` endpoint now accessible to staff users (previously admin-only)
- **Client Scoping Middleware**: Enhanced to support staff user context switching via `X-Client-Context` header
- **Work Order Controllers**: Updated 6 controller functions to bypass client scoping for staff/admin roles:
  - `getWorkOrderById()` - Staff can access any work order by ID
  - `deleteWorkOrder()` - Admin-only (staff blocked per constitution)
  - `updateWorkOrder()` - Staff can update work orders across all clients
  - `getSummary()` - Staff see dashboard summary across all clients
  - `getAllWorkOrders()` - Staff see all work orders with optional client filtering
  - `getAuthorizedPersons()` - Staff see authorized persons filtered by selected client

### 🛡️ Security & Middleware
- **X-Client-Context Header**: Staff users can now use this header for client context switching (previously admin-only)
- **Context Switching Audit**: Logs show `[STAFF CONTEXT SWITCH]` or `[ADMIN CONTEXT SWITCH]` for audit trail
- **Role Validation**: Comprehensive checks ensure staff cannot delete work orders or access admin routes
- **Client Ownership Validation**: Skip validation for staff/admin roles (per constitution principle)

### 📱 Frontend Architecture
- **ClientFilter Component**: Updated visibility logic to show for both staff and admin roles
- **WorkOrdersPage**: Enhanced `handleClientChange()` to reset authorized person filter
- **AuthorizedPersonFilter**: Updated to send `X-Client-Context` header for staff users
- **Service Layer**: `workOrderService` properly passes `clientId` for context switching

## API Changes

### Endpoints Modified
- **GET /api/clients/list**: Now accessible to staff and admin (previously admin-only)
- **GET /api/work-orders**: Staff users can use `X-Client-Context` header for client filtering
- **GET /api/work-orders/:id**: Staff users bypass client ownership validation
- **GET /api/work-orders/authorized-persons**: Respects `X-Client-Context` header for staff users
- **DELETE /api/work-orders/:id**: Restricted to admin-only (staff users get 403 Forbidden)

### Request Headers
- **X-Client-Context**: Now supported for both staff and admin roles for client context switching

### Response Behavior
- **Client List**: Returns all active clients for staff and admin users
- **Authorized Persons**: Filtered by selected client when `X-Client-Context` header is provided
- **Work Orders**: Staff users see all work orders when no client context specified

## Bug Fixes

### 🐛 Issues Resolved
- **Staff 403 Errors**: Fixed issue where staff users received 403 Forbidden when accessing individual work orders
- **Client Filter Missing**: Staff users now see client filter dropdown (was hidden)
- **Stale Authorized Persons**: Fixed issue where authorized person filter showed incorrect data after client change
- **Client Scoping**: Staff users properly bypass client restrictions per constitution
- **Filter Coordination**: Client and authorized person filters now properly synchronized

## Constitution Updates

### 📜 Version 1.1.0
- **Updated Sections**:
  - Added detailed role-based permission matrix
  - Clarified staff vs admin role distinctions
  - Added enforcement requirements for role-based access control
- **Key Changes**:
  - Staff: Can see all work orders across all clients and update them
  - Admin: Full system access including user management
  - Difference: Staff cannot delete work orders and has no access to admin section

## Database Changes

### Schema Updates
- No schema changes required
- Existing role-based access control utilizes existing columns
- Multi-tenant architecture maintained with `client_id` column

## Security & Access Control

### 🔒 Role-Based Permissions

| Action | Client | Client Admin | Staff | Admin |
|--------|--------|--------------|-------|-------|
| View own work orders | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| View all client work orders | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| View all work orders (multi-client) | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Create work orders | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Update work orders | ❌ | ✅ (own client) | ✅ (all) | ✅ (all) |
| Delete work orders | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Use client filter | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Access admin panel | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Manage users | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |

### 🛡️ Authorization Changes
- **Staff Role Elevation**: Staff users elevated to multi-client access (previously single-client)
- **Delete Protection**: DELETE route changed from `isStaffOrAdmin` to `isAdmin` only
- **Consistent Enforcement**: All controllers apply role checks consistently

## Performance

- **Optimized Filter Queries**: Authorized persons filtered by client to reduce result set size
- **Efficient Context Switching**: Middleware handles client context without extra database queries
- **Smart Data Loading**: Filters only reload when necessary (client change triggers reload)

## Migration Notes

### For Developers
- No database migrations required
- No environment variable changes required
- Constitution updated to v1.1.0 (semantic versioning)

### For Users
- **Staff Users**: Will immediately see client filter and gain access to all work orders
- **Existing Work Orders**: No changes to existing data
- **Permissions**: Staff users can no longer delete work orders (if they could before)

## Known Limitations

- **Client Creation**: Staff users cannot create new clients (admin-only)
