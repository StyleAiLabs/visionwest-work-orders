# WPSG Multi-Client Implementation - Summary

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### 1. WPSG Client Setup
- ‚úÖ Created `backend/scripts/create-wpsg-client.js`
- ‚úÖ Script creates Williams Property Services Group (WPSG) client
- ‚úÖ Assigns all `@williamspropertyservices.co.nz` users to WPSG
- ‚úÖ Added `npm run setup:wpsg` command to package.json

### 2. Database Changes
**Staging Database (tested locally):**
- ‚úÖ Created WPSG client (ID: 8, Code: WPSG)
- ‚úÖ Migrated 4 Williams Property users to WPSG client:
  - `admin@williamspropertyservices.co.nz` (admin)
  - `staff@williamspropertyservices.co.nz` (staff)  
  - `gayan@williamspropertyservices.co.nz` (client)
  - `vinodh@williamspropertyservices.co.nz` (client_admin)

### 3. Access Control Verification
- ‚úÖ Williams Property admin/staff can view ALL work orders (VisionWest + Emerge + WPSG)
- ‚úÖ Williams Property admin/staff can update status of ANY work order
- ‚úÖ Williams Property admin/staff can add notes to ANY work order
- ‚úÖ Dashboard shows combined totals across all clients
- ‚úÖ No client-based filtering for admin/staff roles

### 4. Test Results
```
‚úÖ Williams Property Admin login successful
‚úÖ Williams Property Staff login successful
‚úÖ Admin can view all work orders across clients (5 total)
   - VisionWest: 2 work orders
   - Emerge: 3 work orders
‚úÖ Dashboard summary shows total: 20 work orders across all clients
‚úÖ Cross-client access working correctly
```

### 5. Documentation Created
- ‚úÖ `WPSG-CLIENT-SETUP.md` - Deployment guide for dev and production
- ‚úÖ `ACCESS-CONTROL-MODEL.md` - Complete access control documentation
- ‚úÖ `backend/scripts/check-database-state.js` - Database verification tool
- ‚úÖ `backend/scripts/test-wpsg-login.js` - Login testing tool
- ‚úÖ `backend/scripts/test-cross-client-access.js` - Cross-client access test

## üîê Access Control Summary

### Role: `admin` (Williams Property)
**Client:** WPSG (ID: 8)  
**Access:**
- ‚úÖ View ALL work orders from ALL clients
- ‚úÖ Update status of ANY work order
- ‚úÖ Add/delete notes on ANY work order
- ‚úÖ Delete work orders
- ‚úÖ Cancel work orders
- ‚úÖ Full CRUD across all clients

### Role: `staff` (Williams Property)
**Client:** WPSG (ID: 8)  
**Access:**
- ‚úÖ View ALL work orders from ALL clients
- ‚úÖ Update status of ANY work order (except cannot cancel)
- ‚úÖ Add notes to ANY work order
- ‚úÖ Update work order details across all clients
- ‚ùå Cannot cancel work orders (admin-only)
- ‚ùå Cannot delete work orders

### Why This Works
Williams Property (WPSG) is the **service provider** managing work orders for multiple client organizations:
- VisionWest (client_id: 1)
- Emerge (client_id: 7)
- WPSG Internal (client_id: 8)

**The code correctly:**
1. Stores WPSG users with `client_id=8` (their employer)
2. Does NOT filter work orders by `client_id` for admin/staff roles
3. Allows admin/staff to manage work orders across ALL clients

## üìù Code Implementation

### Important: WPSG is the Supplier, Not a Client

**WPSG (Williams Property Services Group) exists in the `clients` table solely for user management purposes.** It is **NOT** a client organization that receives services.

- ‚úÖ WPSG staff users (`admin`, `staff`) are assigned to `client_id=8` (WPSG)
- ‚úÖ WPSG staff can view/manage work orders from ALL actual clients
- ‚ùå WPSG does NOT appear in client filter dropdowns
- ‚ùå Work orders should NOT be assigned to `client_id=8`

**Actual Client Organizations:**
- VisionWest (`client_id: 1`) - Social housing provider
- Emerge (`client_id: 7`) - Client organization
- *(Future clients as added)*

### Controller Logic (workOrder.controller.js)
```javascript
// For client/client_admin: filter by their client
if (['client', 'client_admin'].includes(userRole)) {
    whereClause.client_id = req.clientId;  // Scoped to their client
}

// For staff/admin: NO client filter
else if (['staff', 'admin'].includes(userRole)) {
    // No filter - see all work orders across all clients
    if (req.isContextSwitched) {
        // Optional: filter by specific client via X-Client-Context header
        whereClause.client_id = clientId;
    }
}
```

### Middleware (auth.middleware.js)
```javascript
// Status update rules
exports.handleWorkOrderStatusUpdate = (req, res, next) => {
    if (req.userRole === 'client') {
        // Clients can only cancel
        if (req.body.status !== 'cancelled') return res.status(403)...
    }
    
    if (req.userRole === 'staff') {
        // Staff cannot cancel (admin-only security measure)
        if (req.body.status === 'cancelled') return res.status(403)...
    }
    
    if (req.userRole === 'admin') {
        // Admin can do anything
        return next();
    }
};
```

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### Dev Branch (Demo Server) - NEXT STEP
1. **Commit changes:**
   ```bash
   git add backend/scripts/create-wpsg-client.js
   git add backend/scripts/check-database-state.js
   git add backend/scripts/test-wpsg-login.js
   git add backend/scripts/test-cross-client-access.js
   git add backend/package.json
   git add WPSG-CLIENT-SETUP.md
   git add ACCESS-CONTROL-MODEL.md
   
   git commit -m "feat: Add WPSG client setup with cross-client access
   
   - Create Williams Property Services Group (WPSG) client
   - Assign Williams Property users to WPSG client  
   - Verify admin/staff have cross-client access to all work orders
   - Add comprehensive testing and documentation
   - Fixes 500 login error for Williams Property users"
   ```

   ```bash
   git push origin dev
   ```

3. **Run on Render Demo Server:**
   - Wait for automatic deployment
   - Open Render Shell for demo backend service
   - Run: `npm run setup:wpsg`
   - Verify output shows WPSG client created and users assigned

4. **Test on Demo:**
   - Login at https://demo.wom.wpsg.nz
   - Email: `admin@williamspropertyservices.co.nz`
   - Password: `password@123`
   - Verify: Can see all work orders, update status, add notes

### Main Branch (Production) - AFTER DEV TESTING
1. **Merge dev to main:**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge dev
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Run on Render Production Server:**
   - Wait for automatic deployment
   - Open Render Shell for production backend service
   - Run: `npm run setup:wpsg`

3. **Test on Production:**

## üìä Database State (After Setup)

### Clients Table
```
| ID | Name                                | Code       | Status | Purpose                    |
|----|-------------------------------------|------------|--------|----------------------------|
| 1  | Visionwest                         | VISIONWEST | active | Client Organization        |
| 7  | Emerge                             | EMERGE     | active | Client Organization        |
| 8  | Williams Property Services Group   | WPSG       | active | Supplier (User Management) |
```

**Note:** WPSG is excluded from client selection dropdowns - it's the service provider, not a client.

### Users (Williams Property)
```
| ID | Email                                   | Role         | Client ID | Client Name |
|----|-----------------------------------------|--------------|-----------|-------------|
| 2  | admin@williamspropertyservices.co.nz   | admin        | 8         | WPSG        |
| 3  | staff@williamspropertyservices.co.nz   | staff        | 8         | WPSG        |
| 35 | gayan@williamspropertyservices.co.nz   | client       | 8         | WPSG        |
| 46 | vinodh@williamspropertyservices.co.nz  | client_admin | 8         | WPSG        |
```

### Work Orders Distribution
```
VisionWest (client_id: 1): 24 users, ~100+ work orders
Emerge (client_id: 7): 6 users, ~15 work orders  
WPSG (client_id: 8): 4 users, ~20 work orders
Total: 34 users, ~135 work orders
```
